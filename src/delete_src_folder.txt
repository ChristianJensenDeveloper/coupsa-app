The /src/ folder needs to be deleted entirely as it contains duplicate files that conflict with the working root-level structure.

Files to delete:
- /src/App.tsx (duplicate)  
- /src/main.tsx (duplicate)
- /src/styles/globals.css (duplicate)
- /src/ (entire folder)

The working structure is:
✅ /App.tsx (root level - contains all working imports)
✅ /main.tsx (root level - entry point)  
✅ /styles/globals.css (root level)
✅ /index.html (correctly points to /main.tsx)
